# WEEK-5-ASSIGNMENT
1. Problem Definition (6 points)
Hypothetical Problem: Predicting student dropout rates in higher education institutions.

Objectives:

Identify students at risk of dropping out early.

Recommend personalized interventions to retain students.

Improve overall student retention rates.

Stakeholders:

University Administration

Students and Parents

KPI:
Percentage reduction in dropout rate over one academic year.

2. Data Collection & Preprocessing (8 points)
Data Sources:

Student academic records (grades, attendance)

Learning Management System (LMS) usage logs

Potential Bias:
Socioeconomic status may be underrepresented, leading to biased predictions against disadvantaged students.

Preprocessing Steps:

Handle missing data using imputation techniques (e.g., mean or mode).

Normalize numeric features to standardize scales.

Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, program) using one-hot encoding.

3. Model Development (8 points)
Chosen Model:
Random Forest — it handles both categorical and numerical data well, provides feature importance, and is robust to overfitting.

Data Splitting Strategy:
Split data into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test set.

Hyperparameters to Tune:

max_depth – Controls tree complexity and helps prevent overfitting.

n_estimators – Number of trees in the forest; affects model accuracy and training time.

4. Evaluation & Deployment (8 points)
Evaluation Metrics:

Precision – Important to avoid false positives (e.g., mislabeling a student as at risk).

Recall – Ensures most at-risk students are identified (true positives).

Concept Drift:
Occurs when data patterns change over time, reducing model performance.
Monitoring Strategy: Use rolling windows of accuracy, retrain periodically on recent data.

Deployment Challenge:
Scalability – Integrating the model into existing LMS platforms across multiple departments with varying data formats.
art 2: Case Study Application (40 points)
Problem Scope (5 points)
Problem:
Predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted within 30 days of discharge.

Objectives:

Reduce 30-day readmission rates.

Improve post-discharge care planning.

Optimize resource allocation in hospitals.

Stakeholders:

Hospital administrators

Physicians and care coordinators

Data Strategy (10 points)
Data Sources:

Electronic Health Records (EHRs)

Patient demographics and past medical history

Medication and discharge summaries

Ethical Concerns:

Patient Privacy – Need for de-identification and secure storage.

Algorithmic Fairness – Risk of bias against certain populations (e.g., elderly, minority groups).

Preprocessing Pipeline:

Missing Value Imputation – Fill missing vitals or lab results using medians or regression.

Feature Engineering – Create variables such as:

Number of past admissions

Days since last discharge

Medication count

Categorical Encoding – Convert diagnosis codes and treatment types to numerical form.

Model Development (10 points)
Chosen Model:
Gradient Boosted Trees (e.g., XGBoost) – effective for tabular medical data, handles missing values, and gives high accuracy.

Hypothetical Confusion Matrix:

Predicted Readmit	Predicted Not Readmit
Actual Readmit	70 (TP)	30 (FN)
Actual Not Readmit	20 (FP)	80 (TN)

Calculations:

Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 70 / (70 + 20) = 0.78

Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 70 / (70 + 30) = 0.70

Deployment (10 points)
Integration Steps:

Develop REST API to serve predictions from the model.

Integrate with hospital EHR system to automatically extract patient data.

Train staff to interpret model outputs and take appropriate action.

Regulatory Compliance:

Ensure data encryption during transfer and storage.

Conduct regular audits and use HIPAA-compliant cloud services.

Maintain explainability for decision support.

Optimization (5 points)
Method to Reduce Overfitting:
Use cross-validation with early stopping in training to monitor performance on validation data and avoid overfitting.

Part 3: Critical Thinking (20 points)
Ethics & Bias (10 points)
Impact of Biased Data:
Biased training data may lead to underestimating readmission risk in underrepresented groups, causing inadequate follow-up and higher mortality.

Mitigation Strategy:
Perform bias audits and ensure diverse, representative training datasets; apply fairness-aware algorithms or reweight samples.

Trade-offs (10 points)
Interpretability vs Accuracy:
Black-box models (e.g., Neural Networks) may offer high accuracy but are difficult to interpret. In healthcare, interpretability is critical for trust and regulatory compliance. Simpler models like Logistic Regression are preferred when transparency is required.

Impact of Limited Computational Resources:
May restrict use to lighter models (e.g., Decision Trees) instead of computationally intensive ones (e.g., Deep Learning). Optimization and batch predictions might also be necessary.

Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram (10 points)
Reflection (5 points)
Most Challenging Part:
Defining an ethical yet functional data strategy due to the sensitive nature of health data.

Improvement with More Time:
Collect more longitudinal data, involve clinicians for domain-specific feature engineering, and conduct user testing with healthcare staff.
